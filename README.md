## Configuration

### Settings
- `removeEmojis.excludePatterns`: Array of patterns to exclude when processing folders (default: `["node_modules", ".git", "dist", "out", ".vscode-test"]`)
- `removeEmojis.showPreviewBeforeRemoval`: Show preview of changes before removing emojis (default: `false`)

## How It Works

The extension uses comprehensive Unicode regex patterns to detect emojis across all Unicode blocks, including:
- Emoticons (U+1F600-U+1F64F)
- Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (U+1F300-U+1F5FF)
- Transport and Map Symbols (U+1F680-U+1F6FF)
- And many more Unicode ranges...

When an emoji is removed, the extension intelligently handles surrounding whitespace:
- Removes extra spaces when emoji is between words
- Cleans up leading spaces when emoji starts a line
- Preserves intentional formatting and indentation
